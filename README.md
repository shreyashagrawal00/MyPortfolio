# SHREYASH AGRAWAL | 🦾 TRANSFORMER PORTFOLIO

A high-end, cinematic web experience built with Next.js 15 and Framer Motion. This portfolio features a scroll-driven "Transformation Sequence" where a mechanical vehicle metamorphoses into a humanoid robot, synchronized precisely with the user's scroll progress.
